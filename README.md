### About openMic
openMic is a poetry app or media, built to share and showcase poetic talent of all kinds.

### Built With
---------------
1. Node: Was used to build the server
2. PostGres: For storing all the data from the app.

## Project Planning:
Trello was for the planning of the app. This listed the different stages and tasks worked through progressively. Through the use of diagram.io, the flow of information and the different components that currently exist in the react front end was created.

## Key Features
In the building of the server, JWT Secret and bcryt were included. Both of these help improve the security of the application and minimize unauthorized processes from users.

To ensure that all requests to the different endpoints where responded to, different conditions and scenarios were considered and responses provided.
